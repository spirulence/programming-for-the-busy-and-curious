# Programming for the Busy and Curious

Welcome to _Programming for the Busy and Curious_. I'm your host, Cameron, and I've been programming in Python and other programming languages for more than ten years. This is the resource I wish I had when I was starting out in programming. This course is designed to get you started on your own programming journey. It's my firm belief that the future belongs to the technically literate, and that if you're reading this, that you can be a part of that future with a little help.

I'll need some curiousity from you to make this all work, but not much else. You'll need a healthy dose of that, plus some ability to type, an internet connection, and an email account. Again, if you're reading this text right now from Github, you can do this.

I also know that you're probably very busy, no matter what stage of life you're in. All of the lessons here are designed to take twenty minutes or less, so that you can fit them in somewhere without too much hassle.

## How to use this

The first few lessons are all about setting up your environment, and I recommend doing them in order. We start with the language Python, a versatile first language. You'll learn the basics of working in VS Code, a developer toolset that many professional programmers use to build great software.

After that, it's up to you. I've got a suggested ordering where we gradually increase the complexity of the projects and tools, but if something is really boring you, feel free to skip around.

Lastly, I have done my best to keep the lessons concise, but I also know that sometimes, I really wanted to know more about a particular topic. Where possible, I've added that detail in clearly marked optional sections for you to dive deeper if you wish.

## Let's go!

The stage is set - let's start setting up your environment! Right now I am assuming you're reading this on Github, but soon you'll be working in a real programmer's environment. ![Click here to go to lesson 1.](section-01-environment/lesson-01-gitpod.md)
