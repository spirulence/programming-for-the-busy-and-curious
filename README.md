# Python Learning

Welcome to this fan-made companion resource for the book _Learn Python Quickly: A Complete Beginner's Guide to Learning Python, Even If You're New to Programming_, available on Amazon. The authors of this repo are not associated with the authors of the book.

The book is designed to be short and easily digested: we go further into detail in this repository for the folks who want more detail. It's okay to stick to the book! I just know that when I was learning programming, I hungered for deeper examples on some of the topics.

This repository is divided into chapters and sections, corresponding to the parts of the book. Exercises, where possible, are set up as unit tests, where _you_ fill in the code required to make the magic happen. More on that when you get to it.

## VS Code

The authors of the book recommend PyCharm for the IDE to use: it's a great piece of software, but it presents a lot of buttons and features that would have overwhelmed me as a beginning programmer. We provide instructions for VS Code here, which is similarly powerful but tucks most of the complexity away.

Grab a copy of VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ if you want to follow along.
