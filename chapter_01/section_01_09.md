### Section 1.9 - Good Programming Practices

Lucky for us, VS Code includes good support for the PEP8 standard mentioned in the book. Even better, it can fix a lot of style mistakes with the Format Document command. It will call out most style issues that it can't fix automatically.

To see an example of a formatting issues, navigate to `chapter_01/section_01_09_bad_formatting.py`. This file has a few too many blank lines in a couple of places, and it also has too many spaces on one of the lines.

To automatically fix this file, run the `Format Document` command from the Command Palette.

It's a good practice to run this command on your files every once in a while - good formatting helps your code be understandable by other developers.
