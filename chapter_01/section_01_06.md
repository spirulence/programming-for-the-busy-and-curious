## Section 1.6 - The Python Interpreter

You've made it to the first part of the book where you'll write a program! Congrats!

To open the terminal in VS Code, press the key-combo `` CONTROL-SHIFT-` ``.

After it's open, type `python` and then press the `ENTER` key to get into the Python interpeter.

Try out the statements listed in the book; particularly
- `print("words of your choice here")`
- `help()`
- `exit()` or `quit()`

### More detail - Hello World!

I know this may not seem like you've accomplished a whole lot - but even the most accomplished programmers write programs like this when they're learning a new language or set of tools. This is called a "Hello World" program, and the most popular form in Python would be:

```print("Hello, World!")```

So now the next time one of your programmer friends says "I got as far as writing Hello World," know that you've actually just done that! It's definitely a rite of passage in the programming world, and for a language like Python that has an interpreter, it's totally valid to write it in the interpreter.
